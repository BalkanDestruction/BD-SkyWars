[SIZE=4][B]longer updated[/B][/SIZE]

SkyWars is no longer receiving updates and support. The project was fun while it lasted, but it is no longer. If you wish to take over SkyWars, please contact me at daboross@daboross.net.

[SIZE=4][B]Update warning![/B][/SIZE]

SkyWars v2.0.0 will fail to start on any craftbukkit version below 1.7.8. If you need to use an earlier version of Minecraft, please download SkyWars v1.4.4 instead.

SkyWars v2.0.0 adds UUID support, which is why it requires a newer CraftBukkit version.

After updating to v2.0.0, SkyWars will migrate it's storage from names to UUIDs as users log into your server.

This way there is no long transfer period, and it supports any proxies (bungeecord, lilypad), as long as they forward UUIDs to CraftBukkit.

[B][SIZE=4]MCStats / Plugin metrics[/SIZE][/B]
SkyWars uses plugin metrics to keep track of people using the plugin. All gathered data can be viewed at[URL]http://mcstats.org/plugin/SkyWars[/URL]. To opt out, change opt-out: false to opt-out: true inplugins/PluginMetrics/config.yml

[B][SIZE=4]SkyWars Report[/SIZE][/B]
SkyWars has the ability to use gist.github.com to generate a debug report for your server. When you use the /sw report command, SkyWars will gather information about your server, post it to gist.github.com, and give you a URL. SkyWars does not communicate with gist.github.com unless an admin uses the /sw report command. If you want to make it so that no one can use the /sw report command, add the following line to your main-config.ymlfile: disable-report: true
