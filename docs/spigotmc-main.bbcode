[SIZE=5][B]SkyWars is back![/B][/SIZE]

SkyWars is back! The first publicly released SkyWars plugin is now receiving intermittent updates, and has full support for Minecraft 1.9.

SkyWars v2.1.0 and above use a new arena backend, which comes with faster arena creation, and no longer requires SkyWarsBaseWorld.

If you were previously using SkyWars v2.0.1 or earlier, SkyWars will transfer all custom arenas to the new backend, so please [B]back up all SkyWars and arena data[/B] before updating. If you were previously using SkyWars v1.4.5 or earlier, the update will also convert all user data from name-base to UUID-based storage.

[SIZE=5][B]PSA: Vote on new features[/B][/SIZE]

I haven't been completely active lately with updates, but I'll be adding things when I can. Due to my limited time, I'll be implementing the features with the highest votes first, on the [URL='http://www.strawpoll.me/embed_1/10498111']feature poll[/URL].

Note: There's a new poll as of June 15th, 2016! If you haven't voted since then, [URL='http://www.strawpoll.me/embed_1/10498111']click here[/URL]!

[SIZE=5][B]Translations / Localization[/B][/SIZE]
All player messages fully translated to English and German, and partially translated to Spanish, French, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese and Russian. Partial translations were at one point complete, but don't have some of the newer messages translated.

Change the locale SkyWars uses by setting [B]locale[/B] in [B]main-config.yml[/B].

To help out SkyWars by translating it into your local language, go to [URL='https://github.com/SkyWars/SkyWars-Translations/wiki/Translating']SkyWars-Translations/Translating[/URL]. Test out your localization as well by copying into [B]messages.yml[/B]!

[B][SIZE=5]MCStats / Plugin metrics[/SIZE][/B]
SkyWars uses plugin metrics to keep track of people using the plugin. All gathered data can be viewed at [URL]http://mcstats.org/plugin/SkyWars[/URL]. To opt out, change opt-out: false to opt-out: true inplugins/PluginMetrics/config.yml

[B][SIZE=5]SkyWars Report[/SIZE][/B]
When the [B]/sw report[/B] command is used, SkyWars will submit a debug report for your server including server version, a list of all plugins, and other information to [B]gist.github.com[/B].

SkyWars will not publicly post information about your server to gist.github.com unless an admin uses the [B]/sw report[/B] command. If you want to completely disable this functionality, add the following line to your [B]main-config.yml[/B] file: [B]disable-report: true[/B].
