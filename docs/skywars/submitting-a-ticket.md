Submitting a ticket
===================

## Feature requests

A few guidelines:

* Include a detailed description of the feature requested.
* Include why the feature would be a good thing to have.

## Bug report guidelines

* Run **/sw report** on your server if you are able to. Include the output url in your ticket.
* Include a detailed description of what is happening.
* Search your server log file for errors, and include any of those.

## Questions

Feel free to also delete the template in the ticket submission area, and just ask a question if you want to! There's no need for it to be a bug report or feature request for it to be a valid ticket.

## Actually submitting
