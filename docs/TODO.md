SkyWars Tasks
=============

[ ] Better team integration
  [ ] Colors for team names?
  [ ] Choosing teams before a match?
    [ ] This might need a "custom queue" support, or a specific teamed mode.
[ ] Multiple queues for each arena
[ ] Custom queues (password protected?)
  [ ] Like /sw join mysecretpassword
  [ ] Maybe with /sw custom <arena> <password>?
[ ] Option to only broadcast messages to players in the games.
[x] Sometimes items dropped in previous games are still there in new games.
    This will need some kind of item-removal thing in each world provider to fix.
[ ] Force start on a timer
[ ] "Update arena" option for when arenas are stored as .blocks files?
[ ] Import schematics into .blocks files.
[ ] Respawn immediately
[x] Implement `/sws createkit`
